### MyAid+
## Your recovery all under control

MyAid+ is a group project designed as final project of a Web Development bootcamp that took place in Paris from January to March 2023.

Based on a real need of a group member's relative, we decided to create, customize and bring to life an app that *takes care of our treatment organisation*.

You can view and add your prescriptions (pills, treatments, exercises) and your appointments.
You get reminders to deal with them, and it is possible to dynamically confirm that you have interacted with them.

We designed this app specifically for people that may not be in their best condition before, during, or after a treatment / operation.
Therefore, we decided to create an app that is user-friendly, that gets rid of all unnecessary information and that is easy to use.
We spent a long time on the forms to make sure that these sometimes boring inputs became easy to use and lovable.

**_Basically, we designed something that is strictly useful._**

In order to support people during their treatment, we also designed the possibility to track the evolution of their condition, through selfies, texts, pain and motivation scales.
The idea is to be able to follow up on one's personal medical diary.

To bring some light in a treatment, we decided to organize a part of the app around "Motivationa Boosts", that are here to reboost when people are down.
Whether thanks to motivation quotes, favourite pictures, or connection to music, we aimed at making people in treatment feeling better.

If you like the app, feel free to play with it.
We are very proud of our work, but worked only 2 weeks on it.
Many improvements could be done!
